Here’s a basic `README.md` that explains what HTML is:

# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML, or **HyperText Markup Language**, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by defining the content and layout, which is then styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive using JavaScript.

## What is HTML?

HTML is the backbone of all web pages, providing a structure that allows browsers to display text, images, videos, and other media. HTML consists of **elements** (or tags), which are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`). Each element tells the browser how to display the content inside it.

HTML is essential for:
- Structuring web pages.
- Embedding multimedia like images, videos, and audio.
- Linking to other web pages or resources.
- Formatting text (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.).

## Basic HTML Syntax

Here is a simple example of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph on my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata like the title of the page.
- `<body>`: Contains the content visible on the page, such as text, images, and other elements.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. Each element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements, like images (`<img>`), are self-closing and don’t require a closing tag.

### Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```

Commonly used elements:
- **Headings**: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., define headings on the page.
- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` for creating text paragraphs.
- **Links**: `<a href="url">Text</a>` for creating hyperlinks.
- **Images**: `<img src="image-url" alt="image description">` for embedding images.

## HTML5

**HTML5** is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements and attributes for modern web development. It supports audio, video, and canvas for dynamic graphics without needing plugins. It also improved support for mobile devices and APIs like **Geolocation** and **Local Storage**.

Key new features in HTML5 include:
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>`: Semantic tags for better page structure.
- `<video>` and `<audio>`: For embedding multimedia directly in HTML.
- `<canvas>`: For rendering graphics on the fly using JavaScript.

### Example:
```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## How to Create an HTML File

To create your first HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor like **Notepad**, **VS Code**, or **Sublime Text**.
2. Write a basic HTML structure (similar to the example above).
3. Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
4. Open the file in any web browser to see your webpage.

## Popular HTML Tags

Here are some essential HTML tags:
- `<h1> to <h6>`: Headings of different levels.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag for links.
- `<img>`: For images.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered and ordered lists with list items.
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`: For creating tables.
- `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`: For creating forms and user inputs.
