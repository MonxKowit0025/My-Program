# Speech2Text Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Speech-to-Text (Speech2Text)** system, which converts spoken language into written text. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system can analyze audio input and generate an accurate textual representation of the speech.

## Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Converts live speech to text.
- **Audio File Transcription**: Supports various audio formats (e.g., WAV, MP3) for transcription.
- **Multilingual Support**: Can handle speech input in different languages.
- **Punctuation Prediction**: Automatically adds punctuation to the generated text.
- **Noise Handling**: Capable of processing noisy audio input.

## System Architecture

1. **Audio Input**: The system captures speech from a microphone or processes an audio file.
2. **Acoustic Model**: Converts audio signals into phonetic sounds.
3. **Language Model**: Predicts words based on the sequence of phonemes and the context of the speech.
4. **Text Output**: Outputs the corresponding text after processing.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the system in real-time or process pre-recorded audio files. Below is an example of transcribing audio from a file:

```python
from speech2text import Speech2Text

# Initialize the model
stt = Speech2Text()

# Transcribe from an audio file
audio_file = "audio_sample.wav"
transcription = stt.transcribe(audio_file)
print("Transcription:", transcription)
```

For real-time speech recognition:

```python
stt.listen_and_transcribe()
```

## Audio File Support

The system supports the following audio file formats:
- WAV
- MP3
- OGG
- FLAC

## Training

To train the model on your own dataset:

1. Prepare the audio data and corresponding transcripts in the appropriate format.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 20
    ```
