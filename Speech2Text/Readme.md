Here’s a basic Python example of **text-to-speech (TTS)** using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library. This library allows you to convert text to speech using Google’s TTS engine.

### Requirements:
1. Install the necessary library:
   ```bash
   pip install gTTS
   ```

2. Optionally, you can use the `playsound` library to play the audio after generating it:
   ```bash
   pip install playsound
   ```

### Example Code:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os
# Optional: To play the generated speech directly
# from playsound import playsound

# Function to convert text to speech and save it to an audio file
def text_to_speech(text, language='en', slow=False, output_file="output.mp3"):
    # Create a gTTS object
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=language, slow=slow)
    
    # Save the speech to a file
    tts.save(output_file)
    print(f"Speech saved to {output_file}")

    # Optional: Play the audio file
    # playsound(output_file)

# Example usage:
text = "Hello, welcome to the Text to Speech demo using Python!"
text_to_speech(text, language='en', slow=False)
```

### Explanation:
- **text_to_speech**: This function converts the input text to speech and saves it as an MP3 file. It takes the following parameters:
  - `text`: The text you want to convert to speech.
  - `language`: The language code (e.g., `'en'` for English, `'es'` for Spanish).
  - `slow`: If set to `True`, the speech will be slower. The default is `False`.
  - `output_file`: The name of the file where the speech will be saved (default is `"output.mp3"`).

- **gTTS**: This is a Python interface to Google Translate’s text-to-speech API.

- **playsound** (optional): This allows you to play the generated speech file right after it’s created.

### Languages Supported
You can change the `language` parameter to many languages. Some common ones are:
- `'en'`: English
- `'es'`: Spanish
- `'fr'`: French
- `'de'`: German

You can find the full list of supported languages [here](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#available-languages).
