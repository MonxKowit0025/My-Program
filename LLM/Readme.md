## Introduction

Llama 3.2 is designed to handle both **text and visual tasks**, making it one of the first language models to integrate these two domains effectively. With its ability to run efficiently on **edge devices** (such as smartphones and tablets), Llama 3.2 offers a versatile solution for a wide range of applications, from document analysis to voice interaction.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Llama 3.2 can handle both text and images, allowing for tasks like **image recognition**, **chart analysis**, and **visual question answering**.
- **Edge Device Deployment**: With lighter models (1B and 3B parameters), Llama 3.2 can run on local devices without requiring cloud-based processing, ensuring **real-time** results and better **privacy**.
- **Improved Instruction Following**: Enhanced summarization, instruction-following, and general-purpose language tasks.
- **Extended Context Length**: Supports up to **128,000 tokens**, which helps with long-text reasoning and detailed conversation.
- **Safety Features**: Includes built-in tools such as **Llama Guard** for moderating multimodal tasks and controlling content.

## Installation

To use Llama 3.2 in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meta/llama3.2.git
   cd llama3.2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You will need Python 3.7+ and the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Llama 3.2 models**:
   Visit [Meta AI's model repository](https://github.com/meta-ai) to download the models you need for your use case (e.g., 1B, 3B, 11B, 90B parameters).

## Usage

Once installed, you can begin using Llama 3.2 to handle multimodal tasks:

### Text-to-Text Usage
To generate text responses from a given prompt:
```python
from llama3_2 import Llama

model = Llama(model_size='3B')
response = model.generate("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.")
print(response)
```

### Multimodal Usage
For tasks involving both text and images:
```python
from llama3_2 import Llama

model = Llama(model_size='11B')
response = model.analyze_image('path_to_image.jpg', "What is shown in this image?")
print(response)
```

## Use Cases

- **Document Analysis and Visual Processing**: Llama 3.2 excels at interpreting documents with charts, graphs, or embedded images, making it a great tool for industries like finance, research, and education.
- **Voice Assistants**: With **real-time voice interaction**, Llama 3.2 is well-suited for building conversational AI agents and voice-controlled devices.
- **Edge Computing**: Lightweight models allow it to be deployed on **local devices** for applications needing quick responses and **high data privacy**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Loading Issues**: Ensure you have enough GPU resources for larger models (e.g., 90B parameter versions).
- **Multimodal Errors**: Check that the input images are in supported formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) and that the image paths are correct.
